# optimal_control
We solve for minimum time optimal control input to stop an undamped harmonic oscillator(pendulum)
to bring to origin,starting from any position and velocity and  minimum time and fuel optimal control input to stop a car on a frictionless x-axis and
finally bring to the origin, starting from any position and velocity . for both input is constrained between -1 and +1.
